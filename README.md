# Malaria
Malaria is known to be a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
It causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can lead to jaundice, seizure and coma which could eventually lead to death. I find the need to know the prevalence of malaria in the world, the death rate, total number of confirmed and death cases and the most affected countries in the world important, so downloaded the dataset from kaggle and used Microsoft excel for the analysis. [Here is the link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/malaria-dataset)
